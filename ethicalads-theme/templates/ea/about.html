            <h2>Small Team. Big Impact.</h2>

            <p>EthicalAds was built to sustain open source development of Read the Docs, an open source documentation platform. Advertising was the natural model because it scaled up well as our platform grew. However, we wanted to do ads right without tracking users or having security issues with third-party scripts. Since no existing ad networks would partner with us on privacy-respecting ads, we built our own.</p>

      <p>Eric cofounded Read the Docs and took it from a hackathon project in 2010 to full-time in 2014. Experimenting with funding models led him to create EthicalAds to make Read the Docs sustainable and now he wants to bring that to the wider open source community. He previously worked at Urban Airship and the Lawrence Journal-World, the home of the Django web framework.</p>

Previously David worked on security at Qualcomm and Amazon before being director of technology at TapHunter.</p>
