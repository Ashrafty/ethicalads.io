Happy New Year! December was a shorter month for us at EthicalAds so this update will be short and sweet. 

## New features

These are the major features we released in the last month:

* Debuted the beta for our [sponsorship platform](https://www.ethicalads.io/sponsorship-platform/).
* Released our [advertising prospectus](https://www.ethicalads.io/prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf) for 2022.

You can always see our latest server updates in our [ethical-ad-server changelog](https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html) and [ethical-ad-client changelog](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html).


## December advertising stats

In December 2021:

* We generated **$31,782.17** for our publishers.
* We had **102 publishers** on our network with at least one paid ad impression.
* We had **13,654,617** paid ad views across the world.

As expected, our views did decrease precipitously during the holidays (down around 40% from November),
but our revenue only decreased by 8% over the same time.
This was due mostly to some large, inexpensive campaigns wrapping up
in addition to launching some highly targeted campaigns with a higher avergae CPM. 

## Tricky bits

Onboarding new publishers remains our largest hurdle to growth.
We're attempting to combat this by creating and sharing interesting new content,
like our first [publisher interview](https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2022/01/publisher-spotlight-series-ido-shamun-from-dailydev/) with the creator of daily.dev Ido Shamun.

## Upcoming features

Not many items on our roadmap were changed in the December flurry but 
we are conducting exciting research into incorporating more complex natural language processing methods as a part of our decision engine.

The major features in our upcoming roadmap:

* Improved keyword extraction occuring in the ad server as opposed to the ad client.
* More intuitive graphs in the ad server for advertisers and publishers.
* Adding view time reporting to ensure high quality views are counted as such.
* Highlighting our 10% discount on ad buys over $3000 in the flight report page.



Thanks again for being along with us on this journey to build an ethical ad network.
