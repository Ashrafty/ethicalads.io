## New features

Happy New Year! Here are the major features we released in the last month:

* Rolled out our new [floating ad](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#placement-style) type for all of the projects on Read the Docs.
* Debuted the beta for our [sponsorship platform](https://www.ethicalads.io/sponsorship-platform/).

You can always see our latest server updates in our [ethical-ad-server changelog](https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html) and [ethical-ad-client changelog](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html).


## December advertising stats

In December 2021:

* We generated **$31,782.17** for our publishers.
* We had **102 publishers** on our network with at least one paid ad impression.
* We had **13,654,617** paid ad views across the world.

As expected, our views did decrease precipitously during the Holidays,
but our revenue was actually still larger than September's and fairly close to October's.
Imagine our surprise to see that our revenue actually increased in November by just over 8%!

## Tricky bits

Onboarding new publishers remains our largest hurdle to growth.
We're attempting to combat this by creating and sharing interesting new content,
like our first [publisher interview](link) with the creator of daily.dev Ido Shamun.

## Upcoming features

The major features in our upcoming roadmap:

* Improved keyword detection in the ad client.
* Improved graphs in the ad server for advertisers and publishers.
* Adding view time reporting to ensure high quality views are counted as such.
* Highlighting our 10% discount on ad buys over $3000 in the flight report page.
