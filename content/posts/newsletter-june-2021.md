## New features

These are the major features we added in the last month:

* In our ad server, we updated the weighting algorithm to slightly bias showing CPC ads on higher CTR publishers.
* Our ad server now tracks historical changes to ad campaigns,
  allowing us to track changes over time to better understand performance. 
* Also in our ad server, we added actions to allow our staff to handle
  adding new publishers and execute publisher payouts.
* On our website, we updated our [prospectus]({static}/prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf) and [pricing]({filename}/pages/advertisers.md#pricing) information for Q3.
* We also recently expanded our [Publisher Guide]({filename}/pages/learning-hub/publisher-guide.md) on the Learning Hub.

You can always see our latest server updates in our [ethical-ad-server changelog](https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html).


## June advertising stats

June was a slight improvement over May for advertising
as we had some new ad buys start as well as a couple new publishers.

In June 2021:

* We generated **$24,362.13** for our publishers.
  Of this, $12,696.56 was to third-party publishers, with the rest to Read the Docs.
* We had **106 publishers** on our network with at least one paid ad impression.
* We had **14,574,934** paid ad views across the world.

Reminder, we are actively working to onboard
new, high quality publishers, which will expand our ad inventory.


## Tricky bits

We are still verging on max capacity with regards to ad inventory.
Marketing and growth is a challenge for any small business.
To address this, we rolled out a number of new house ads across the network.
Unfortunately, determining the success of these new ads is difficult
without tracking users or conversions.
We are looking into privacy preserving analytics options for our website.


## Upcoming features

The major features in our upcoming roadmap:

* Adding a staff interface for customizing ad flights is currently our top priority.
* We are still in the process of designing a referral system for our current publishers.
* View time for ads will allow us to ensure a fair system for counting valid views
  as well as provide a metric for publisher quality.
