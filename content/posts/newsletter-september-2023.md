## New features

Our progress in September was:

* We produced two content pieces about what happens
  when a publisher on our network [truly goes viral]({filename}../posts/2023-going-truly-viral.md)
  and one on [optimizing European ad campaigns in the GDPR era]({filename}../posts/2023-european-landing-pages-gdpr.md).
* Our ad server hit v3.0 when we upgraded Django, a core dependency
* Our [Q4 prospectus]({static}../prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf) is up on our site.
  It contained small price increases for specific [audiences]({filename}/pages/advertisers.md#audiences)
  in the US & Canada.

You can always see our latest server updates in our
[ethical-ad-server changelog](https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html)
and [ethical-ad-client changelog](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html).


## September advertising stats

[comment]: https://server.ethicalads.io/publisher/all/report/?start_date=2023-09-01&end_date=2023-09-30

In September 2023:

* We generated **$38,554.01** for our publishers. This is down slightly from August but is about the same on a day by day basis accounting for the shorter month.
* We had **173 publishers** on our network with at least one paid ad impression.
* We had **18,374,509** paid ad views across the world. A slight increase over August.

October is trending a bit higher than September
so we're expecting a slightly stronger month.
We are running a few very broadly targeted campaigns by both geography and topic
which usually results in a higher percentage of our overall inventory being sold.


## Upcoming features

The major features in our upcoming roadmap for October:

* The advertiser reporting features that will help integrate our metrics with Tableau
  to update performance metrics automatically, is continuing but very slowly.
  We're aiming to collaborate with a few advertisers who use Tableau (or something similar)
  to make sure we build exactly what our advertisers want.
  If you're interested in this, please [get in touch]({filename}../pages/contact.md)!
* We are making some improvements to better handle multiple ad placements on the same page.
  Our policy is still to not have our ads beside competitors' ads
  and to have just 1 ad at a time,
  but there are some situations like very long pages where multiple ad placements make sense.


Thanks again for being along with us on this journey to build an ethical ad network.
Please [email us](mailto:ads@ethicalads.io) if you have any ideas or feedback on our product or roadmap,
