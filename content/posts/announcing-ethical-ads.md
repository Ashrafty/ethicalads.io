We're excited to announce the release of the EthicalAds network,
an ad network for privacy-focused developers.
We have been working towards this vision for years,
and we're excited to welcome folks to our new network.

Ethical advertising as a concept was something we [originally conceived](https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2016/aug/31/funding-oss-marketing-money/#funding-read-the-docs) for Read the Docs back in 2016.
We have been working on building a sturdy business around advertising ever since.
With the news that CodeFund was [shutting down](https://twitter.com/codefundio/status/1278119643937296384) on July 1,
we moved forward our plans to launch our own ad network.

We've spent the last month and a half onboarding over 50 publishers and 5 advertisers from CodeFund,
and now we're ready for more.
We're excited to officially announce that we're open for additional publishers and advertisers.

## The vision

Ethical ads respect users while still providing value to advertisers.
The overall vision is pretty simple:

* We donâ€™t track you or sell your data
* We target ads based on the content of the current page, not your past browsing history
* We are as transparent in our business as possible
* We only make money showing ads

As we talked about in our [2018 blog post](https://blog.readthedocs.com/ethical-advertising-works/): **ethical advertising works**.
We're so happy that we can build a business while respecting our users privacy.

## The future

We are planning to grow slowly in the near term,
making sure that everything we've built is ready for scaling outside publishers.
We've already learned a number of lessons in the last month,
and we want to make sure it works for everyone involved.

Ethical advertising is our vision for the future of the internet,
and we hope that you'll join us.
We have space for additional publishers and advertisers,
and look forward to building something meaningful with you all.
