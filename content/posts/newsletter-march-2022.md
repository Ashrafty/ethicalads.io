## New features

These are the major features we released in the last month:

* Upgraded to Django 3.2
* Expanded our [Advertiser's Guide]() to include more examples of great ads.
*

You can always see our latest server updates in our [ethical-ad-server changelog](https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html) and [ethical-ad-client changelog](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html).


## March advertising stats

In March 2022:

* We generated **$$31,060.46** for our publishers.
* We had **108 publishers** on our network with at least one paid ad impression.
* We had **15,283,991** paid ad views across the world.

Despite being 10% shorter than January, our revenue increased by 1.67% in February!
This puts us  on track for a great March.
Our [Sponsorship Management Platform](https://www.ethicalads.io/sponsorship-platform/?ref=jan-newsletter) Beta also
once again served over **2,500,000** sponsored logo placements in February.

## Tricky bits

We're on track to be sold out in North America and Europe in April!
Thus our attention turns back to acquiring more publishers and expanding our network.


## Upcoming features

The major features in our upcoming roadmap:

* Reworking our topic-detection infrastructure and algorithm in our server.
* Highlighting our 10% discount on ad buys over $3000 in the flight report page.
