## New features

These are the major features we released in the last month:

* Launched semi-automatic campaign wrap-up emails. Advertiser's now get a one glance view of any campaigns that have ended, campaigns which are currently running, and a 1 reply ask to make re-ups easier than ever!
* Expanded our [Advertiser's Guide](https://www.ethicalads.io/advertiser-guide/?ref=newsletter) to include more examples of great ads.
* Updated our [Privacy Policy](https://www.ethicalads.io/privacy-policy/?ref=newsletter) to explicitly mention our usage of 3rd party analytics platform, Plausible.
* Improved our interface with the PSF expanding our [Sponsorship Management Platform](https://www.ethicalads.io/sponsorship-platform/?ref=jan-newsletter).

You can always see our latest server updates in our [ethical-ad-server changelog](https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html) and [ethical-ad-client changelog](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html).


## March advertising stats

In March 2022:

* We generated **$31,749.65** for our publishers.
* We had **118 publishers** on our network with at least one paid ad impression.
* We had **14,605,352** paid ad views across the world.

March continued to pick up steam and resulted in even more revenue for our publishers.
We also expanded our network adding 10 more publishers in March alone!

Our [Sponsorship Management Platform](https://www.ethicalads.io/sponsorship-platform/?ref=jan-newsletter) Beta also
once again served over **2,500,000** sponsored logo placements in February.

## Tricky bits

We're on track to be sold out in North America and Europe by the end of April!
This is great news for our publishers as it means we're able to pay them more money for their traffic.
Our attention now turns back to acquiring more publishers and expanding our network to accomodate all of our advertisers' campaigns.


## Upcoming features

The major features in our upcoming roadmap:

* Reworking our topic-detection infrastructure and algorithm in our server.
* Highlighting our 10% discount on ad buys over $3000 in the flight report page.
