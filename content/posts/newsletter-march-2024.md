There's a small change from past newsletters for this month.
Rather than publishing a February newsletter in early March,
we're just going to call it our March update.
What isn't changing is that we're still going to discuss our progress
from February and what's coming in the rest of March.


## New features from February

* We released a feature to target campaigns by the day of the week.
  This was a minor feature but a couple advertisers wanted to run only weekend campaigns.
  We've discussed it in the past, but our network's traffic on weekends
  is less than half a normal weekday.
* We've made a lot of progress toward some big changes in our
  [machine learning based contextual targeting]({filename}../posts/2022-content-based-targeting.md).
  These changes will let us target a lot of niches that were previously too hard or too small to target.
  We are still aiming for a public demo this month!
* We are experimenting with some self-serve features to let advertisers
  who know exactly what they want to start a campaign without doing a call with a co-found^D^D^D sales rep.
* There were some UX and other improvements aimed at new and returning publisher
  including added support for GitHub Sponsors as a payout option.
  We're very focused on acquiring premium publishers right now and we're
  promising we'll beat their existing ad network's revenue
  for a similar placement by 10% for at least 3 months.
* We released a [publisher revenue calculator]({filename}../pages/publisher-calculator.md)
  to help publishers get an idea of how much they'll earn with EthicalAds.
  If you try it out, we'd love [your feedback]({filename}../pages/contact.md). It's new!

You can always see our latest server updates in our
[ethical-ad-server changelog](https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html)
and [ethical-ad-client changelog](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html).


## February advertising stats

[comment]: https://server.ethicalads.io/publisher/all/report/?start_date=2024-02-01&end_date=2024-02-29

In February 2024:

* We generated **$47,124.69** for our publishers.
  This is just a little shy of our best month (March 2023)
  but on a 30 day basis, it is the best we've had.
* We had **177 publishers** on our network with at least one paid ad impression.
* We had **19,009,922** paid ad views across the world.

This near revenue record is mostly due to us bringing on a few good sized publishers
this month including [eslint.org](https://eslint.org/) and [dev.to](https://dev.to/).


## Upcoming features

The major features in our upcoming roadmap for March:

* As I mentioned above, we're aiming for a technology demo
  for our updated ML targeting where advertisers can see the most relevant
  pages on our network to their landing or product page. We're really excited for this.
* We're working on a number of landing pages focused on publishers
  and generally smoothing out our onboarding process for publishers.
  To start, this will be an updated [publisher guide]({filename}../pages/learning-hub/publisher-guide.md).
* We have some UX improvements coming for advertisers as well
  including better ways to compare campaigns with different prices and CTR on an eCPC basis.

Thanks again for being along with us on this journey to build an ethical ad network.
Please [let us know]({filename}../pages/contact.md) if you have any ideas or feedback on our product or roadmap,
we always love to hear from you.
