## New features

These are the major features we released in July:

* Our machine learning model that analyzes the content around where our ads appear
  so we can show the best possible ad rolled into production.
  Showing the best possible ad makes more money for publishers and shows advertisers' ads
  in the right context to perform amazingly.
* In our ad client, we released an
  [ad fixed to the footer](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#fixedfooter).
  Already a number of publishers have chosen it and it performs great!
* In our [audiences section]({filename}/pages/advertisers.md#audiences),
  we added some details of the top publishers across our network
  for each of the major topics we focus on.

You can always see our latest server updates in our [ethical-ad-server changelog](https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html) and [ethical-ad-client changelog](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html).


## July advertising stats

In July 2022:

* We generated **$35,670.95** for our publishers.
* We had **131 publishers** on our network with at least one paid ad impression.
* We had **14,563,179** paid ad views across the world.

We continue to see strong demand for advertising and these figures are just below
our all time records.


## Our wins

We received [a very nice review](https://www.developermarkepear.com/blog/paid-advertising-developer-marketing)
from a customer on a developer marketing blog
that has resulted in a significant number of advertiser prospects asking for more information.
There's truly no greater praise than a customer telling others about us.


## Tricky bits

For August, we did see a large advertiser reduce spending
and we expect a small slowdown over the month.
We have 3-4 advertisers who each account for about 10% of our total revenue
and losing one of them results in unsold inventory.
Running an ad network is always a balance between supply of ad placements
and demand for developer eyeballs and finding that balance can be tricky
especially since advertising is usually not sold in contracts longer than a quarter.


## Upcoming features

The major features in our upcoming roadmap:

* We received some [great feedback](https://twitter.com/AsiaOrangio/status/1552277640953745408)
  on our product positioning and landing pages and we are working to improve our marketing
  and positioning in August.
  We are also reading a book on positioning
  (["Obviously Awesome"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45166937-obviously-awesome) for the curious)
  in our [company book club]({filename}/posts/book-club-tips-and-reviews.md).
* In August, we dealt with a fair amount of ad scammers testing our defenses.
  Fortunately, we were able to discover them quickly and protect ourselves and our advertisers.
  This is a constant battle and hopefully we can share some of what we've learned
  and some of the brazen tactics from the scammers in an upcoming post.
* We plan on making a number of improvements to our ad reporting for advertisers
  including speeding up performance and showing more graphs, maps, and charts
  to help make sense of all the data.

Thanks again for being along with us on this journey to build an ethical ad network.
