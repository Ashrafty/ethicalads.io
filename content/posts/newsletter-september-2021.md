## New features

These are the major features we released in the last month:

* Our new [prospectus](https://www.ethicalads.io/prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf) came out. 
  We raised the geo-prices in the US and EU in order to combat our overbooking issue and earn more money for our publishers.  
* We added a read replica database which improves the performance of our dashboard.
* In the advertiser dashboard, when you copy an advertisement to a new flight, they're ordered by the age of the ad, newest first. 
* Now when a 'Contact Us' form is filled out, we ask if they would like to start receiving our newsletter. 

You can always see our latest server updates in our [ethical-ad-server changelog](https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html) and [ethical-ad-client changelog](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html).


## September advertising stats

In September 2021:

* We generated **$31,380.78** for our publishers.
* We had **103 publishers** on our network with at least one paid ad impression.
* We had **19,238,786** paid ad views across the world.

September was our best month to date in terms of paid views and revenue! 
We had a 12% increase in September's revenue from August which was a 15% increase from July before that. 

Part of our revenue improvements were due to price increases that went into effect over the last quarter
and partially due to selling more of our harder to sell inventory.
Our effective cost per thousand impressions (eCPM) across the US & Canada has improved from $XX in June to $YY in September
and our eCPM in Asia-Pacific improved from $AA in June to $BB.
This means more money in the pockets of our publishers.

## Tricky bits

We still have the fortunate problem of being overbooked in the US and EU especially,
which has resulted in many of our on-going campaigns falling behind schedule.
We've adjusted our roadmap priorities to focus more heavily on publisher acquisition.
We are also looking into additional ways of managing pricing,
so that we are able to better determine priority of ads across time. 


## Upcoming features

The major features in our upcoming roadmap:

* New landing pages describing our open source ad network and the benefits of being a data science publisher on our network. 
* Adding graphs to our advertising dashboard.
* Highlighting our 10% discount on ad buys over $3000 in the flight report page.
* Infrastructure improvements to better manage our load and isolate reporting from our live transactional data.
