## New features

These are the major features we released in the last month:
 
* In the ad server, we now have graphs describing key insights for advertisers and publishers.
* We added new landing pages describing our open source ad network and the benefits of being a data science publisher on our network.
* Demoed a new floating ad type on [Read the Docs' own documentation](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). 
* Added reporting on our ad server so we can know which reports people are engaging with. 

You can always see our latest server updates in our [ethical-ad-server changelog](https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html) and [ethical-ad-client changelog](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html).


## October advertising stats

In October 2021:

* We generated **$32,097.44** for our publishers.
* We had **102 publishers** on our network with at least one paid ad impression.
* We had **19,714,391** paid ad views across the world.

What's really exciting about October is that although we only had 
a 2.5% increase in the number of paid views from September,
in October we saw a 7.5% increase in our paid clicks! 
Just over **24,000** paid ads were clicked in October
As we grow, we can be more selective with our advertisers, 
ensuring users on the EthicalAds network see only high quality, relevant ads 
that you might actually be interested in. 

## Tricky bits

We continue expanding our network by onboarding new publishers. 
To accomplish this, we're focusing on raising the eCPM in a variety of ways. 
Firstly we raised the prices this quarter on our highest demand traffic.
Secondly, we're phasing out CPC or Cost Per Click pricing. 
This ensures our publishers get paid for their views and 
incentivizes our advertisers to craft high performing, attractive ads. 

You can see our progress by observing the increase of our publisher payouts over time:

## Upcoming features

The major features in our upcoming roadmap:

* Improved graphs in the ad server for advertisers and publishers. 
* Adding view time reporting to ensure high quality views are counted as such. 
* Highlighting our 10% discount on ad buys over $3000 in the flight report page.
* Infrastructure improvements to better manage our load and isolate reporting from our live transactional data.
