## New features

These are the major features we released in the last month:
 
* In the ad server, we now have graphs describing key insights for advertisers and publishers.
* We added new landing pages describing our open source ad network and the benefits of being a data science publisher on our network.
* Demoed a new floating ad type on Read the Docs. 
* Added reporting on our ad server so we can know which reports people are engaging with. 

You can always see our latest server updates in our [ethical-ad-server changelog](https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html) and [ethical-ad-client changelog](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html).

## Tricky bits

We still have the fortunate problem of being overbooked in the US and EU especially,
which has resulted in many of our on-going campaigns falling behind schedule.
We've adjusted our roadmap priorities to focus more heavily on publisher acquisition.
We are also looking into additional ways of managing pricing,
so that we are able to better determine priority of ads across time. 


## Upcoming features

The major features in our upcoming roadmap:

* Improved graphs in the ad server for advertisers and publishers. 
* Adding view time reporting to ensure high quality views are counted as such. 
* Highlighting our 10% discount on ad buys over $3000 in the flight report page.
* Infrastructure improvements to better manage our load and isolate reporting from our live transactional data.


Thanks again for being along with us on this journey to build an ethical ad network.
