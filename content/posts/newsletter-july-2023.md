## New features

Our progress in July was:

* We rolled out some new frequency capping features that allow
  setting maximum percentages of a campaign that will fill
  on certain publishers or in certain countries or regions.
  This will help us balance campaigns and should result in better advertiser performance.
* We implemented a hard stop date for advertising campaigns.
  Some campaigns absolutely need to stop on a certain date
  because they promote a certain event or time-sensitive release.
  This feature should help advertisers run these kinds of campaigns
  and credit any remaining balance that wasn't filled.
* We made a number of landing page adjustments to highlight
  our ad-agency-lite customer service features we do for advertisers.
  Lots of advertisers ask for guidance in creating or tweaking ads
  both before and during campaigns in order to maximize performance.
  We know that every ad network is a little different due to different ad formats or a slightly different audience.
  That's why we check-in on campaigns to make sure advertisers are getting the most for their ad dollars
  and propose changes that advertisers can make to their campaign.
  Typically, these are some of the things an ad agency would do for an advertiser
  and we do it to help us retain advertisers.

You can always see our latest server updates in our

## July advertising stats

[comment]: https://server.ethicalads.io/publisher/all/report/?start_date=2023-07-01&end_date=2023-07-31

In July 2023:

* We generated **$41,849.75** for our publishers. This is up a bit from June.
* We had **170 publishers** on our network with at least one paid ad impression.
* We had **25,941,085** paid ad views across the world.

July slightly outperformed June which was a nice surprise.
As with last month, we continue to be almost completely booked up in the US and Canada
and have a little bit of spare capacity in Europe (although that is tightening up due to the price drop).

August is trending about the same as July and we expect it to be flat to a small improvement.


## Upcoming features

The major features in our upcoming roadmap for August:

* We've seen some increased advertiser demand for some reporting features
  that they can plug into their own dashboards.
  We are still gathering requirements, but we expect to move quickly on this.
* We intend to put together a content piece about what happens
  when a publisher on our network [truly goes viral](https://twitter.com/ethicaladsio/status/1626239820891832327).
* We are building more pricing features directly into our ad server.
  Historically, we've updated prices quarterly in our
  [prospectus]({static}/prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf)
  but because some campaigns have non-standard targeting or have volume discounts,
  our ad server set the price per flight
  rather than having standard prices for each geographic/topic combination.
  This is another feature that will help us get our network closer to self-serve.


Thanks again for being along with us on this journey to build an ethical ad network.
