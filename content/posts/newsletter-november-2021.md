Last month we were able to get the whole ads team together for our first ever in-person EthicalAds meetup! 

## New features

These are the major features we released in the last month:

* Rolled out our new [floating ad](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#placement-style) type for all publishers as well as implemented its usage on Read the Docs' [own documentation](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). This is an opt-in feature that publishers can choose if they want a floating ad in the corner which is a pretty common setup.
* Added a stripe integration so advertisers can view previous invoices. 
* Clarified flight completion/budget remaining progress bar. 
* Made some infrastructure improvements to better manage our load and isolate reporting from our live transactional data.

You can always see our latest server updates in our [ethical-ad-server changelog](https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html) and [ethical-ad-client changelog](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html).


## November advertising stats

In November 2021:

* We generated **$34,679.11** for our publishers.
* We had **102 publishers** on our network with at least one paid ad impression.
* We had **19,103,581** paid ad views across the world.

Given that November has a US holiday in it, 
we expected a drop in revenue and views. 
Imagine our surprise to see that our revenue actually increased in November by just over 8%!

## Tricky bits

The holidays tend to slow down traffic and thus ad views/revenue across the world.
We are expecting a decrease in our key performance metrics as the year wraps up. 

## Upcoming features

The major features in our upcoming roadmap:

* Improved graphs in the ad server for advertisers and publishers.
* Adding view time reporting to ensure high quality views are counted as such.
* Highlighting our 10% discount on ad buys over $3000 in the flight report page.
* Improved keyword detection in the ad client.
