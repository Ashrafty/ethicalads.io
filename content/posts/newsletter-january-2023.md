## New features

These are the major features we released in January:

* We made numerous reporting and performance improvements
  to our advertiser and publisher platform.
* Our ML model has been updated to improve performance. It has also been migrated into it's own private repository, so that we can iterate on it without compromising data privacy of our users. 
* We got a couple content pieces out on [Privacy Week 2023]({filename}../posts/2023-data-privacy-week.md)
  and on [protecting yourself from security and privacy issues on big ad networks](#).

<!-- IMPORTANT: Update with link when we merge the ad blocker post -->


You can always see our latest server updates in our [ethical-ad-server changelog](https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html) and [ethical-ad-client changelog](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html).


## January advertising stats

[comment]: https://server.ethicalads.io/publisher/all/report/?start_date=2023-01-01&end_date=2023-01-31&campaign_type=paid&revenue_share_percentage=All+shares&sort=name

In January 2023:

* We generated **$32,078.53** for our publishers.
* We had **147 publishers** on our network with at least one paid ad impression.
* We had **12,686,867** paid ad views across the world.

As we expected from the guidance in our [December newsletter]({filename}../posts/newsletter-december-2022.md),
January was a rough month for advertising and losing one of our biggest clients will do that.

However, we expect February to be a significantly better month from an ad sales perspective
although not as good as some of our best months ever at the end of last year.
With the price reduction we put in place for Q1, we have multiple advertisers
increasing the size of their campaigns.
While ad budgets are tight and despite economic gloom in the news,
we haven't seen that much spillover into actual campaigns.


## Upcoming features

The major features in our upcoming roadmap for February:

* We aim to update our advertiser guide with more examples of successful ads
  and concrete ways to track and measure the success of your ad campaigns
  (without compromising privacy).
* We aim to support GitHub Sponsors as a payout option for open source projects.
* We are working on some changes to how we pace ads over the day and over a campaign.
  We believe there are a number of optimizations to help campaigns perform a little better.

Thanks again for being along with us on this journey to build an ethical ad network.
