Last month, we released a new feature in our ad client
that enabled publishers to quickly and easily add a floating, text-only ad placement
fixed to their site footer without having to write custom code.
Ensuring an ad is unobtrusive, visible,
and fits with the rest of a website goes a long way toward having good ad performance.
By having a well-tested, high-performing placement out of the box,
we can help publishers get something that works well quickly.


## Usage

This feature is available to any publisher who wants to use it
by setting the `data-ea-style="fixedfooter"` attribute on their ad placement.
The mobile and desktop optimized ad is displayed without an image
and only takes up a minimal amount of real estate on the page.
See our [full documentation](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#fixedfooter) on the feature for details.

A number of publishers had requested this feature and a few had built it themselves
for their own site and we wanted to have a base implementation available for all our publishers.
Already we've been recommending it to some new and a few existing publishers
and we've seen a number of them choose use it.

If there are features you're interested to see in our ad client,
please [let us know]({filename}/pages/contact.md).
