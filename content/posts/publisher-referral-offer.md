Want to help grow EthicalAds and our privacy preserving vision for the future of advertising? 
We are currently at ad capacity and are thus looking to expand our number of publishers. 

## Our Offer

Refer a new publisher to EthicalAds and once they join the network, 
you'll get a onetime **$50 bonus** to your payout when they earn their first payout. 

## A Good Fit

Not every publisher who applies to join the EthicalAds network is approved.

* Our network is focused exclusively on developers in order to keep the content and audience well-targeted without creepy tracking.
* Sites ought to have more than 10k hits in a month in order to see revenue in a timely fashion. 
* Ideally they'll be value-aligned in our goal of a private internet for all. 

Feel free to spread the word perhaps with this tweet:

SUBJECT: Ethical Advertising Network Referral

Hey [Friend],

To make money, I host EthicalAds on my website and I think you'd be a good fit too. 
They're a privacy focused company who is building an open-source ad network for devs. 
I like that they respect the privacy of my users and don't store any user data. 
Check them out: https://www.ethicalads.io/publishers/?referral= [your email address]

Thanks, [your name]
