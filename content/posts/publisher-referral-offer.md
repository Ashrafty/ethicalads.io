## Our Offer

Want to help grow EthicalAds and our privacy preserving vision for the future of advertising?
Refer a new publisher to EthicalAds and once they join the network, 
you'll both get a onetime **$25 bonus** to your payouts when they earn their first payout. 

## A Good Fit

Not every publisher who applies to join the EthicalAds network is approved.
* We are developers ourselves and are interested in content aimed at developers. 
* Sites ought to have more than 10k hits in a month in order to see revenue in a timely fashion. 
* Ideally they'll be value-aligned in our goal of a private internet for all. 

If you know of someone who sounds like a good fit, consider sending them a message:

Hey [Friend],

To make money, I host EthicalAds on my website and I think you'd be a good fit too. 
They're a privacy focused company bootstrapped by the people at Read the Docs. 
I like that they respect the privacy of my users and don't store any user data. 
Right now they're running a promotion where if you mention me at sign-up, 
we both get $50 on your first payout. [Check them out](https://www.ethicalads.io/publishers/?ref=publisher-referral).

Thanks, [your name]
