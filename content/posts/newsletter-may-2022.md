## New features

These are the major features we released in the last month:

* In May, we rolled out the ability for publishers to show their own fallback house ads
  when we don't have a paid ad to show.
You can access it on `Fallback Ads` menu in your publisher dashboard, if you want to try it out.```
* After seeing the success of the small onboarding improvements in our ad server,
  we reworked a number of our standard customer support responses
  to help get new publishers and advertisers on the platform as easily and quickly as possible.
* Our keyword analyzer is now spidering across the most visited pages in our network.
  This helps us better understand the content where we show ads, curate topics, and show the most relevant ad.
* We did some initial work on building more targeting and pricing information into our ad server.
  Specifically, having multiple preset regions and topics based on what advertisers frequently buy.
* On the marketing front, we produced a page on how we are
  [different from other developer ad networks like CarbonAds]({filename}../pages/vs-carbon-ads.md?ref=newsletter)


You can always see our latest server updates in our [ethical-ad-server changelog](https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html) and [ethical-ad-client changelog](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html).


## May advertising stats

In May 2022:

* We generated **$39,991.85** for our publishers. Just a hair under $40k which we hope to break in the coming months.
* We had **125 publishers** on our network with at least one paid ad impression.
* We had **16,183,111** paid ad views across the world.

May was another record breaking month in terms of revenue and it's great to keep the network growing.
Revenue was very consistent over the month and showed the usual ebb and flow of our traffic
with peaks on weekdays and valleys on weekends.


## Tricky bits

Unfortunately, we said goodbye to our wonderful account manager and customer success rep Ra
who left us for what sounds like an amazing data science role in New York City.

Although we hand-approve our publishers, we do continuously go back and look at low performers.
In May, we worked with a few low performers to try to improve the ad placements on their site.
While we had some successes here and a large publisher and some small ones were able to bring their
numbers up, a few publishers had to be offboarded from the network.


## Upcoming features

The major features in our upcoming roadmap:

* We're continuing to work on our topic-detection infrastructure.
  We made improvements in May and expect to continue to iterate here in June.
* In June, we expect to have a new publisher spotlight post ([our first with daily.dev]({filename}./2022-publisher-spotlight-series-dailydev.md)).
* We will also have an updated [Q3 prospectus]({static}../prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf)
  in the next few days.

Thanks again for being along with us on this journey to build an ethical ad network.
