## New features

These are the major features we released in the last month:

* The [About Our Audience](https://www.ethicalads.io/our-audience/?ref=newsletter) page now features a snazzy graph depiting the volume of our traffic for each topic.
* Rolled out the [floating ad placement](https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2022/03/floating-ad-placements-in-our-ad-client/?ref=newsletter) to more domains on Read the Docs.
* Optimized our aggregation algorithms to keep us informed regarding our network and traffic more rapidly than ever.
* We made a number of performance optimizations to keep our ads serving as fast as possible.
* We rolled out a change to use Cloudflare's geolocation in our ad targeting. This seemed a better way to keep up-to-date and also to avoid billing for ads where the geolocation can't be determined (eg. Tor).

You can always see our latest server updates in our [ethical-ad-server changelog](https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html) and [ethical-ad-client changelog](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html).


## February advertising stats

In February 2022:

* We generated **$$31,060.46** for our publishers.
* We had **108 publishers** on our network with at least one paid ad impression.
* We had **15,283,991** paid ad views across the world.

Despite being 10% shorter than January, our revenue increased by 1.67% in February!
This puts us  on track for a great March.
Our [Sponsorship Management Platform](https://www.ethicalads.io/sponsorship-platform/?ref=jan-newsletter) Beta also
once again served over **2,500,000** sponsored logo placements in February.

## Tricky bits

We're still slightly undersold in February but making gains everyday.
March is on track to beat February but in order to really set us over the top,
we're trying to close more globally targetted campaigns.
The EthicalAds audience extends all around the globe!
Getting new and exciting tools in front of developers that actually help them solve problems
they're working on right now, is always exciting.
Filling our global traffic with good offers is where we have the most room to grow in this capacity of serving our community.


## Upcoming features

The major features in our upcoming roadmap:

* Reworking our topic-detection infrastructure and algorithm in our server.
* Highlighting our 10% discount on ad buys over $3000 in the flight report page.
* Expanding our advertiser's guide with even more examples of great ads.
