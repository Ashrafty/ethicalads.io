## New features

These are the major features we released in the last month:

* Giving the publisher the ability to turn off/on their own payouts, managing their own payment schedule.
* In the ad client, we shrunk the size of the client by about 40% which results in faster load times.
* We released our Surveillance Advertising informational page to the [Learning Hub](https://www.ethicalads.io/surveillance-advertising/).
* We updated our [Publisher Guide](https://www.ethicalads.io/publisher-guide/)
  with an example of a great placement and some explanation as to why they are so desirable.

You can always see our latest server updates in our [ethical-ad-server changelog](https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html) and [ethical-ad-client changelog](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html).


## August advertising stats

In August 2021:

* We generated **$27,913.01** for our publishers.
* We had **104 publishers** on our network with at least one paid ad impression.
* We had **18,521,177** paid ad views across the world marking another increase over July's ~14 million views.

We started a number of new global campaigns this month which boosted our paid view count significantly,
although we are still limited by publishers across the network. 


## Tricky bits

We still have the fortunate problem of being overbooked in the US and EU especially,
which has resulted in many of our on-going campaigns falling behind of schedule.
In order to honor our existing advertising flights, we're scheduling out new flights to start in October.
We're also releasing our new prospectus in October, raising the price of these overbooked geos.


## Upcoming features

The major features in our upcoming roadmap:

* Adding graphs to our advertising dashboard.
* Adding "view time" statistics to our reporting, so that we can better understand how ads are performing.
* Highlighting our 10% discount on ad buys over $3000 in the flight report page.
