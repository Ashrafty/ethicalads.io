## About Me

We all tell ourselves stories to live. Some find comfort in narrative, believing events *had* to go a certain way in order to become the person that they are today; others enjoy the *conflict* of the setting, basking in the pure chaos of the universe. As long as there have been people, there have been stories to contextualize our place in history, society, and the world. From cave paintings to modern media, from Homer's Odyssey to Homer Simpson, the storyteller has captured the hearts, minds, and wallets of dreamers and makers alike, for isn't **advertising** another story? One that piques the interest of the passerby, invoking a call to action with the promise of a better tomorrow? 

I'm Ra Cohen, the latest addition to the EthicalAds team. Using pretty pictures, willful words, and data science, I'm on a mission to help people reach their audience and tell their story.    


## Pretty Pictures

Humans are visual creatures and it is difficult to overstate the importance of the graphical component of advertising. Guided by the Data-ink ratio, we've found crisp, minimalistic designs, AKA **pretty pictures**, to be most complementary to our publisher's content and thus effective at generating interest. Dedicated to producing excellent outcomes for advertisers and publishers alike, we are happy to assist new advertisers in advertisement creation and to advise experienced advertisers on what types of ads work best on our unique network.    

A picture may be worth a thousand words, but context can make it worth a million. 


## Willful Words

Good writing is the intersection of clarity and purpose. Conveying information and motivating one's audience are best accomplished by the **willful word**, a word mindfully chosen to perform work and left free of clutter. Due to the brevity of advertising, the creatively willful word thrives. The attention of your reader is valuable and respected. We are happy to assist in the creation of your advertising copy upon request. Your time is valuable too, so I endeavor to keep all emails to the point as I assist with advertiser and publisher account management. 

I am also happy to schedule a phone call to discuss your data. 


## Data Science

Like all science, the first step to data science is to ask a ***question***. Are you a publisher who wants help understanding how our latest updates affected your profits? Or do you want to compare your data over a few ad placement spots in order to maximise your click through rates? Perhaps you're an advertiser who wants to know how changing your targeting will affect your total number of impressions. Send us an email! I'll crunch the numbers to answer your specific question.  


As always, we are thrilled to have you along with us on our journey to build an ethical ad network.
Please [email us](mailto:ads@ethicalads.io) if you have any ideas or feedback on our product or roadmap,
we always love to hear from you.
