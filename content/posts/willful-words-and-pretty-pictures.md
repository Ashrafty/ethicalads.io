## About Me

We all tell ourselves stories to live. Some find comfort in **narrative**, believing events *had* to go a certain way in order to become the person that they are today; others enjoy the **conflict** of the **setting**, basking in the pure chaos of the universe. As long as there have been people, there have been stories to contextualize our place in history, society, and the world. From cave paintings to modern media, from Homer's Odyssey to Homer Simpson, the storyteller has captured the hearts, minds, and wallets of dreamers and makers alike, for isn't advertising just another story? One that piques the interest of the passerby, invoking a call to action with the promise of a better tomorrow? 

I'm Ra Cohen, the latest addition to the EthicalAds team, and a storyteller. Using willful words, pretty pictures, and data science, I'm on a mission to help people reach their audience and tell their story.    


## Willful Words

Good writing is the intersection of clarity and purpose. Objectives like conveying information or tone are best accomplished by the willful word, a word chosen to do work and left free of clutter. In advertising where one must be brief without being terse, the creatively willful word thrives. The time of the reader is valuable and respected. Anytime a new advertiser or publisher sends an inquiry, I get that email. 


## Pretty Pictures

A picture may be worth a thousand words, but context can make it a million.


## Data Science

Like all science, the first step to data science is a **question**. Are you a publisher who wants help understanding how our latest updates affected your profits? Or do you want to compare your data over a few ad placement spots in order to maximise your click through rates? Perhaps you're an advertiser who wants to know how changing your targeting will affect your total number of impressions. Send us an email! I'll crunch the numbers to answer your specific question.  



As always, we are thrilled to have you along with us on our journey to build an ethical ad network.
