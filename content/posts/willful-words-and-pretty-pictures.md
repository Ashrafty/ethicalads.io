## About Me

As I was telling my grandma about my new job, explaining the evils of google ads tracking you around the web and using big flashy banners to distract you from the content that you're actually trying to read, she was first and foremost concerned that someone was personally listening in to every one of her conversations. Once I cleared up that misunderstanding and started describing how EthicalAds doesn't store anyone's data or allow distracting advertising, my grandma expressed some concern. 

Her father, my greatgrandfather, was a soap salesman himself. One day he was out for a walk by the river early in the morning and he noticed people washing their clothing in the river without bar soap. My greatgrandfather decided then and there to tap that market and would go down on his walk every morning with a box full of soap to sell. Selling by the river early in the morning before the factory opened worked incredibly well until other soap vendors realized the simplistic brilliance of his approach. Soon my greatgrandfather was in competition and learned that he had to get creative with drawing attention. My grandmother cautioned me, "The loud, charismatic vendor inevitably sells more soap than the quiet, reserved one." It stuck me that this is the mindset that has been shaping advertising for the past 100 years. This is how we have arrived at the current state of the internet, almost unbrowsable without an ad-blocker thanks to pop-ups, banner ads, and booby-trapped x's. 

So I asked my grandma what if yelling was out-lawed? The thought had never occurred to her. I told her about ad-blockers, promising to set her up with one next time I visited, and explained that EthicalAds gets around ad-blockers precisely by being quiet, dignified. My grandma thought for a moment. 

"You have your foot in the door, not a seat at the table. Have you considered making your ads beautiful?"   

I'm Ra Cohen, a data scientist, people person, and the latest addition to the EthicalAds team. Using pretty pictures, willful words, and data science, I'm on a mission to help people reach their audience and tell their story.    


## Pretty Pictures

As a data scientist, I know just how much impact framing and perspective can have on impressions. A graph zoomed in around all of the action will tell a very different, more turbulent story than the same data presented on a graph with its origin at 0. My design philosophy draws from the Data-Ink ratio principle. The less ink you can use over all, the better, and that ink which you do use should be fundamental to conveying your data. Likewise, I've noticed busy ads with lots of decoration have a lower click through rate than a simple static shot of a logo or a black and white tracing of the product. One of my grandmother's suggestions was actually tracing designs out of coloring books before I gently reminded her that copyright infringement exists. I'm proud to use my eye for artistry to help bring beauty to not only data but also advertising for isn't **advertising** another story? One that piques the interest of the passerby, invoking a call to action with the promise of a better tomorrow? 

A picture may be worth a thousand words, but context can make it worth a million. 


## Willful Words

Good writing is the intersection of clarity and purpose. Conveying information and motivating one's audience are best accomplished by the **willful word**, a word mindfully chosen to perform work and left free of clutter. Due to the brevity of advertising, the creatively willful word thrives. The attention of your reader is valuable and respected. We are happy to assist in the creation of your advertising copy upon request. Your time is valuable too, so I endeavor to keep all emails to the point as I assist with advertiser and publisher account management. 

I am also happy to schedule a phone call to discuss your data. 


## Data Science

Like all science, the first step to data science is to ask a ***question***. Are you a publisher who wants help understanding how our latest updates affected your profits? Or do you want to compare your data over a few ad placement spots in order to maximise your click through rates? Perhaps you're an advertiser who wants to know how changing your targeting will affect your total number of impressions. Send us an email; I breathe data! In school, I took courses in our data science graduate program to fulfil my undergrad computer science requirements. After graduation, I went to work as a research scientsit for two years where I built visualization dashboard prototypes for DARPA. I'm glad to now be working at EthicalAds, shaping the future of advertising for a more respectful, beautiful future.
