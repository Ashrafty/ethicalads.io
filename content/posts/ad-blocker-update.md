A few weeks ago, we shared about the
[challenge ad blocking presented to our sustainability]({filename}ads-and-adblocking.md)
and what we were doing about it. On May 4th, Read the Docs
was added to the [Acceptable Ads list](https://acceptableads.com/)
meaning that our visitors running ad blockers who choose to allow
unintrusive advertising will see our ads again. The **impact to our ad
views, clicks, and revenue was immediate**.

Data on our inclusion in the Acceptable Ads list
------------------------------------------------

32% of Read the Docs visitors run an ad blocker

:   Estimates around the web vary regarding what percentage of people
    run ad blockers and it varies heavily by industry. We discussed this
    figure a bit in our
    [previous post]({filename}ads-and-adblocking.md).

It took a month from application to inclusion in the list

:   We discovered about our inclusion in the
    [EasyList](https://easylist.to/) ad blocker list within a couple
    days and immediately applied to the Acceptable Ads program. No
    changes were required of us to meet the [Acceptable Ads
    criteria](https://acceptableads.com/en/about/criteria) and we also
    qualified for [Acceptable Ads without third-party
    tracking](https://adblockplus.org/en/acceptable-ads#privacy-friendly-acceptable-ads).

    While Eyeo, the company behind AdBlock Plus, derives [most of their
    revenue](https://adblockplus.org/about#monetization) from the
    Acceptable Ads initiative by charging large entities, Read the Docs
    **did not** pay for inclusion on the list.

Over half of those running an ad blocker allow acceptable ads

:   Given our more tech-savvy and privacy-focused audience, we didn't
    know what to expect. Not every ad blocker allows acceptable ads by
    default and even then users can choose to turn them off.

People running ad blockers DO click on ads

:   We can definitively say this is true of our audience. Our
    click-through rate did not change based on ad blocking or our
    inclusion in the acceptable ads list at all.

Of the ad views and clicks blocked by ad blockers, inclusion in the
Acceptable Ads list meant that 55-60% of our ad-blocking visitors choose
to allow our ads. This directly translated into revenue toward our
sustainability.

Building our Ethical Ads
------------------------

The Acceptable Ads list is definitely a step in the right direction for
us. We share the goal of unintrusive advertising that respects our
audience.

People understand that advertising funds much of the web. As ads got
larger, more annoying, and ad networks stored more information on
millions of people, however, many people finally decided to install ad
blockers.
This is the [largest boycott in human
history](https://medium.com/the-graph/how-to-reverse-publisher-revenue-drain-c33e41bf0665)
and blaming users isn't the answer.

Based on our experience with ad blocking and the Acceptable Ads list, it
is clear that visitors will allow advertising that doesn't disrupt user
experience and doesn't track people.

We are glad to have made progress toward regaining our sustaining
revenue. Read the Docs is continuing on our experiment to fund open
source infrastructure in a way that is a win/win for all parties, and we
are glad you're following along with us.
