## New features

These are the major features we released in June:

* We made a number of improvements to detecting keywords where we show ads.
  In the end, this project scoped up a little bit and we built a small
  machine learning model that detects what pages are about.
  It will roll into production in July.
* We rolled out an updated [Q3 prospectus]({static}../prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf)
  and a small simplification to our pricing.
* We released a new [publisher spotlight interview]({filename}2022-publisher-spotlight-series-dataskeptic.md)
  with Kyle Polich from Data Skeptic.
* Just to follow up on a May feature, we saw quite a few publishers start using the fallback ads!


You can always see our latest server updates in our [ethical-ad-server changelog](https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html) and [ethical-ad-client changelog](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html).


## June advertising stats

In June 2022:

* We generated **$37,579.32** for our publishers.
  This is slightly down from our record month in May but still very good.
* We had **128 publishers** on our network with at least one paid ad impression.
* We had **15,407,959** paid ad views across the world.

There's a lot of talk of a market downturn but that hasn't shown up yet
in our numbers. We are continuing to see strong demand for advertising.


## Tricky bits

We don't have a true data scientist at EthicalAds or at Read the Docs.
As a result, there's been quite a ramp up in terms of learning the ML state of the art.
We have created a [SpaCy](https://spacy.io/) based text classifier.
This took a lot longer and we will have more to show after it rolls out next month.


## Upcoming features

The major features in our upcoming roadmap:

* As I mentioned earlier, our topic detection has taken a little longer than expected.
  However, the project ballooned in scope as well.
  We are pretty happy with where it is and expect it to roll out this month in July.
* I'm a little late in posting this blog but we released support
  for an [ad fixed to the footer](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#fixedfooter)
  of the page directly to our ad client in early July.
  This allows publishers to have a high performing ad placement without any custom code.
* We are building topic specific landing pages for our core topics
  like data science and security & privacy. The goal is to help our SEO and rank for things
  advertisers search for like "advertising to data scientists".

Thanks again for being along with us on this journey to build an ethical ad network.
