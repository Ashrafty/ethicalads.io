## New features

Here's the major features we added in the last month:

* In our ad server, we added a support form to make it easier
  for advertisers and publishers alike to get in contact with us.
  On our end, we also added  actions to allow our staff to better assist in
  the creation, modification, and management of advertisers and their campaigns.
* On our website, we updated and streamlined our [Community Ad]({filename}/#community-ads) information.
  Now open source community projects can apply to have their ads run for free
  by like-minded publishers when a paid ad is not available.
* We also recently launched our [Learning Hub]({filename}/learning-hub/).
  Your one stop shop resource for information on EthicalAds, our audience, and
  what makes a good advertisement. More on that later.

You can always see our latest server updates in our [ethical-ad-server changelog](https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html).


## May advertising stats

May was a great month for advertising as we had some new ad buys start.

In May 2021:

* We generated **$23,495.17** for our publishers.
  Of this, $11,719.57 was to third-party publishers, with the rest to Read the Docs.
  While not a surprise, this was another all-time record for our third-party publishers!
* We had **104 publishers** on our network with at least one paid ad impression.
* We had **14,659,563** paid ad views across the world.

In May, we undertook an effort to increase the performance of publishers
with the lowest Click Through Rates.
In some cases, we were able to increase performance
while in others, we agreed to part ways.
As we approach our ad capacity, we are actively working to onboard
new, high quality publishers, expanding our ad inventory.


## Learning Hub

Discover more about EthicalAds than ever before right from the navigation bar!
Our new [Learning Hub]({filename}/learning-hub/) collects information regarding
who we are, our  vision for the future of advertising,
and statistics on the make-up of our audience. It also contains:
* Advertiser's Guide which details how to craft a great advertisement
  for *our* audience including insights into what has worked well in the past.
* Publisher's Guide which details how to earn the most money with EthicalAds
  including tips on ad placements,
  the trade-offs between text-only ad and image ad spots,
  and how to increase your CTR and thus your revenue.


## Tricky bits

As I mentioned, we are on the verge of max capacity with regards to ad inventory.
With our processes becoming more standardized, allowing new staff to handle day to day operations,
we are now ready to focus on growing the network.
Marketing and growth is a challenge for any small business.
Luckily, we are privilidged to have a business that gets better the bigger it grows.
More advertisers means more money for publishers and
more publishers means a larger potential audience for advertisers.


## Upcoming features

The major features in our upcoming roadmap:

* Advertisers will be able to view changes that they have requested in the targeting page.
* To detrickify the marketing bit, we are designing a referral system
  for our current publishers. Look for more info on that in the coming weeks.
* Ad Click prioritization will be coming to our network.
  Advertisers who pay per click will be symbiotically matched with
  publishers who have high click through rates.
