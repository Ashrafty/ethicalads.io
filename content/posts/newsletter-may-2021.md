## New features

These are the major features we added in the last month:

* In our ad server, we added a support form to make it easier
  for advertisers and publishers alike to get in contact with us.
* Also in our ad server, we added actions to allow our staff to better assist in
  the creation, modification, and management of advertisers and their campaigns.
* On our website, we updated and streamlined our [Community Ad]({filename}/pages/vision.md#community-ads) information.
  Now open source community projects can apply to have their ads run for free
  by like-minded publishers when a paid ad is not available.
* We also recently launched our [Learning Hub]({filename}/pages/learning-hub/index.md).
  Your one stop shop resource for information on EthicalAds, our audience, and
  what makes a good advertisement. More on that later.

You can always see our latest server updates in our [ethical-ad-server changelog](https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html).


## May advertising stats

May was a great month for advertising as we had some new ad buys start.

In May 2021:

* We generated **$23,495.17** for our publishers.
  Of this, $11,719.57 was to third-party publishers, with the rest to Read the Docs.
* We had **104 publishers** on our network with at least one paid ad impression.
* We had **14,659,563** paid ad views across the world.

In May, we undertook an effort to increase the performance of publishers
with the lowest Click Through Rates.
In some cases, we were able to increase performance
while in others, we agreed to part ways.
As we approach our ad capacity, we are actively working to onboard
new, high quality publishers, which will expand our ad inventory.


## Learning Hub

Discover more about EthicalAds right from the navigation bar!
Our new [Learning Hub]({filename}/pages/learning-hub/index.md) collects information regarding
who we are, our vision for the future of advertising,
and statistics on the make-up of our audience. It also contains:
* Advertiser's Guide which details how to craft a great advertisement
  for *our* audience including insights into what has worked well in the past.
* Publisher's Guide which details how to monetize your audience with EthicalAds.


## Tricky bits

We are on the verge of max capacity with regards to ad inventory.
With our processes becoming more standardized, allowing new staff to handle day to day operations,
we are now ready to focus on growing the network.
Marketing and growth is a challenge for any small business.
Thankfully, an advertising network gets better as it grows bigger.
More advertisers means more money for publishers and
more publishers means a larger pool of specific topics for advertisers.


## Upcoming features

The major features in our upcoming roadmap:

* The most recent changes to targeting will be highlighted in the advertiser's dashboard.
* We are designing a referral system for our current publishers.
* Ad Click prioritization will be coming to our network.
  Advertisers who pay per click will be matched with
  publishers who have high click through rates.
