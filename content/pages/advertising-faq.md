Advertising FAQ
===============

How are ads priced?

:   We have [packages to simplify advertising with
    us](/advertisers/#packages), but you can always put
    together a custom ad campaign. The exact cost will depend on your
    targeting with geography being the biggest factor. See our
    [prospectus](https://assets.readthedocs.org/sustainability/Read%20the%20Docs%20Advertising%20Prospectus.pdf)
    for details.

Can I post an ad promoting my job openings?

:   Absolutely. We have [packages specifically to help you find
    developers](/advertising/hiring/).

How can I target my ads?

:   In line with our [ethical advertising
    approach](/advertising-vision/),
    we believe that ads can be well targeted while respecting users'
    privacy. We only target based on a user's country and the content
    of the page where the ad is served. This is a very powerful approach
    and allows combinations such as ads on Python or JavaScript
    documentation served to developers in the USA and Canada or ads on
    C# and Visual Basic documentation to developers in Austria and
    Germany.

    For ads targeting the USA, we also support targeting by state or by
    metro area (DMA specifically).

    We are beta testing targeting to specific projects or specific
    keywords. If you are interested in participating, please let us
    know.

What are the ad specifications?

:   For sidebar ads, we display a 240*180px image and up to 80
    characters of supporting text. The image will be linked to the same
    page as the supporting text.

    We can also run a fixed-footer ad which is up to 80 characters of
    text without an image. You can use the same text as a sidebar ad or
    run something different if that makes more sense.

    Our
    [prospectus](https://assets.readthedocs.org/sustainability/Read%20the%20Docs%20Advertising%20Prospectus.pdf)
    has the full details and example screenshots.

Where do the ads link to?

:   The ads can link to any URL. Typically they will link to your
    landing page on your website. You may include UTM parameters or
    other URL parameters to know that the traffic came from your ad on
    our site.

How are my ads scheduled?

:   We attempt to schedule advertising evenly based on the length and
    size of your campaign. However, if you want to advertise as fast as
    possible, we can definitely do that.

Can I run my ad JavaScript?

:   In order to respect our users' privacy, we do not allow any
    third-party ad scripts.

How can I see how my ads are performing?

:   Once you become an advertiser with us, you will have access to view
    live reports on the performance of your ads including how many times
    they were viewed and clicked. We count a viewable impression when
    the ad comes into the browser viewport.

Where do my ads appear?

:   Ads appear on sites that belong to our publisher network. Placement
    is customizable based on their requirements, but we always ensure 
    a valuable placement.

What type of ads are acceptable?

:   We want ads that are of interest to our audience of millions of
    software developers.

    EthicalAds has final approval for all ads with respect to
    editorial and creative content but generally this isn't an issue.

Do my ads have to be in English?

:   They can be in any language you like including Spanish, Chinese,
    Java, Ruby, or French.

What are the details of the EthicalAds audience?

:   EthicalAds is 100% software developers of varying skill levels.
    Our peak traffic times for each region is during business hours and
    many people reading the docs are doing so while building software
    professionally. Over 90% of pageviews are for English language
    documentation.

    We have some more details in our [advertising
    guide](https://assets.readthedocs.org/sustainability/Read%20the%20Docs%20Advertising%20Guide.pdf).

Do my ads support open source?

:   EthicalAds is open source software and the ads go to support
    development of the publishers where ads are hosted.

    information form](/advertising/#inbound-form).
    A member of our team will contact you with a detailed prospectus and
    will walk you through the process of getting started advertising on
