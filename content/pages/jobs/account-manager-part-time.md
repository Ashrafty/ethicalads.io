form_subject: Ads Account Manager Job Application


Thanks for your interest in working at Read the Docs on EthicalAds.
We are a small team of five growing slowly and deliberately,
and weâ€™d love for you to join us.


About the company
-----------------

Read the Docs is a large [open source project](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org) providing documentation building and hosting.
You can think of it a continuous integration for docs.
We do around 500 million pageviews each year across hundreds of thousands of projects.

Our ad serving is also [open source](https://github.com/readthedocs/ethical-ad-server)
and powers tens of millions of paid ad impressions every month
without tracking users around the web.
Open source maintainers and other developer-oriented projects earn over $10,000/mo serving ethical ads.
Serving ads on Read the Docs itself is also the largest single source of revenue for our company.

This role specifically is to help manage advertising relationships.
Our primary mission is help sustain open source and deal with our publishers and advertisers in an ethical manner.


About the job
-------------

You will be the first person hired to work exclusively on advertising.
Currently, of our small Read the Docs team, advertising is handled by Eric Holscher and David Fischer.
You will work directly with the two of us and be able to have a big impact!

At any given time, we have 20-30 advertisers running active campaigns
and 80-100 publishers showing paid ads on their sites.
In addition, there is a constant sales pipeline of new advertisers trying our network
and publishers getting things integrated.
These are a lot of relationships to manage and we want to make sure
that both advertisers and publishers get the most out of using EthicalAds.

To start with, this role would be part-time at about 20 hours per week.
You will help with advertiser sales, onboarding new advertisers, and fielding questions from advertisers and prospects.
For publishers, you will help with onboarding and support.
While sales will be part of this role,
this won't be the kind of role where you are generating sales with cold calling or outbound emails.
Our sales process relies heavily on word of mouth and content marketing to get advertisers interested
in our audience and mission.
For publishers, we similarly use the network effects of folks seeing our ads to attract publishers to the platform.
This is a hybrid role between sales and customer support but heavier on the customer service side.
Our goal is to expand this to a full time role later in 2021.

Interest and skills in any of the following is a big plus so please let us know in your application:

* Advertising
* Technical writing and documentation
* Online privacy
* Content marketing


Details and responsibilities
----------------------------

We have emails from publishers, advertisers, and prospective advertisers that come in each day,
and its important for our customers and clients to get good and prompt support.
Part of your responsibilities will be the first level of support and sales on these incoming emails.
We have a shared email inbox for handling this.
We are trying to make onboarding as consistent and repeatable as possible
while still maintaining a human touch of ensuring our publishers are the highest quality
and our advertisers will be the right fit for our audience.

After you get a feel for the common questions that come in,
our goal is to have you create knowledge base content for these common questions.
We want you to grow with us and take more responsibility
in content marketing, blog posts, and making the onboarding process as smooth as possible.
Again, you will be our first outside person for advertising
and our first dedicated customer support hire.
You will have a lot of input on the direction our customer service takes!


Requirements
------------

You will need very clear written communication skills both to clients
and for our website and knowledge base.
Experience in a sales or customer service team is desirable
but if you're excited to talk to clients regularly, you can pick up the necessary skills.

We hope you will grow with us as we grow.
We are a small team and you will be given a lot autonomy in building and improving things,
so being self-driven is an asset.

We are a fully remote company and our team is currently based in the US, South America, and in Europe.
We hope to work with people that are based in a timezone where we have some overlap with the entire team,
which is around UTC-8 to UTC+1.


Structure
---------

To start, this would be a part-time contracting position.
The plan would be for us to contract with you to work between 4-5 days a week for approximately 20 hours per week.
Of our existing team, half of our team works 4 days, and the other half works 5 days,
and we are happy to be flexible with whatever works best for you.
The pay rate will vary with experience and the hours worked but we are budgeting for **$15-20 per hour**.
We are looking for some one who is early career or returning to their previous career
with aspirations to grow into a business role with us
