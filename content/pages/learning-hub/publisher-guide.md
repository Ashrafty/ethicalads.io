subtitle: Good ad placement starts with good focus.

Our [EthicalAds client](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) should get you started hosting ads but for guidance on how to ensure your ads perform well, read on.

## Ad Placement

Without tracking users, the best way to make sure ads perform well
is to have a good placement to have good targeting based on content.
A good ad placement means the ad is clearly visible and separate from the content of the page.
How long the ad is visible on the page is also a factor.
If the UX of your site means that users quickly scroll past ads, the ads on your site won't perform well.

## Ad Types

On the EthicalAds network, there are two main types of ads:
1. Ads with images
2. Ads without images
Which type of ad to place depends a lot on the available real estate of your page.
A banner across the bottom of the page works well on static pages like [jsbin.com](https://jsbin.com/?html,output)
otherwise we've found image ads in the sidebar which are static to scrolling to be really successful.
The majority of our ads do have images so if in doubt, go with the image ad spot.

## Light vs Dark Themes

If your website uses a dark theme, consider adding ```{html} class = "dark"``` as seen [here](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#dark-mode).
This improves performance by helping the text of the ad standout while the rest of the ad blends in.

## Content Tagging

For better content targeting, letting us know about the content of your pages with
[page-specific keywords](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#page-specific-keywords),
can allow us to better target the ads.
For example, we can target an ad for a DevOps related service to DevOps related content.

## Bringing It All Together

Better performance and better targeting will generally result in more money for publishers like yourself.
While most advertisers pay per impression, some pay per click which yields more money for better performance.
Content targeted ads to more specific content can also results in higher click through rates
and we charge higher rates for more targeted ads.
