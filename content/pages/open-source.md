Title: Open Source Ad Network
slug: open-source/
description: Unlike basically all other ad networks out there, our advertising infrastructure is open source and completely transparent.


Advertising nowadays has a bit of a bad reputation.
Companies hoover up data and track people across the internet to show them personalized ads.
Some of these same companies claim it isn't possible to do advertising without tracking users.
That simply isn't true.

Not only has traditional, contextual advertising built almost every brand you can name,
we built a successful ad network without personalized ads.
To do this, we created an open source ad network built on transparency.


## Born from open source

EthicalAds came from our work monetizing [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/),
an open source documentation building and hosting platform.
We had an enormous audience but almost no revenue and no funding.
It's hard to make open source sustainable but ads seemed like a good solution.
Advertising scaled up in revenue as our hosting requirements scaled up.

Our users told us they didn't have a problem with advertising
but they wanted their privacy respected: no tracking and no ad cookies.
At that time, there wasn't an ad network out there willing to work with us on those terms (we looked).
So we built our own.


## Targeted without tracking

In our [ad vision]({filename}vision.md),
ads don't have to know your past history or follow you around the internet to be effective.
Instead, we focus our ad network on developers and only bring on high quality publishers
where we think ads for developers will be successful.
We show that it's possible to run successful ad campaigns without [surveillance advertising]({filename}learning-hub/surveillance-advertising.md).


## Transparent

The code behind most other ad networks is proprietary and complex.
Instead, we are completely transparent in how our advertising works.
You don't need to trust us, our code is open source.
To our knowledge, we're the only open source ad network on the market.
And we're growing.

To be fully transparent, we publish the code that runs our ad server
as well as our ad client that runs on publisher sites.
With our network, you can see exactly how ads are chosen.
Here's our code:

* Ad server: [https://github.com/readthedocs/ethical-ad-server](https://github.com/readthedocs/ethical-ad-server)
* Ad client: [https://github.com/readthedocs/ethical-ad-client](https://github.com/readthedocs/ethical-ad-client)


## Join us

As developers and part of the open source community, we are building the future of advertising.
We understand the privacy issues that impact the internet
and we don't believe that you have to give up your privacy
to run a successful ad campaign or monetize your site or project.

Our network has space for additional publishers and advertisers,
and look forward to building something meaningful with you:
