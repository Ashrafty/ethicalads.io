## Community Ads

We also give our publishers the ability to give back to the community by promoting worthy, relevant causes. There are a large number of projects, conferences, and initiatives that we care about in the software and open source ecosystems. A large number of them operate with almost no income. Our optional Community Ads program highlights these projects by running ad campaigns at no cost.

### Qualifications

There are a few qualifications for our Community Ads program:

- Your organization and the linked site should not be trying to entice visitors to buy a product or service. We make an exception for conferences around open source projects if they are run not for profit and soliciting donations for open source projects.
- A software project should have an [OSI approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses).
- We will not run an ad under this program for an organization tied to one of our paid advertisers.
