[TOC]


## What data can I see about the ads?

We have reports for the following data:

* Revenue - This shows the total revenue per day. The most important report :)
* Geos - Top countries your traffic comes from are monetizing
* Advertisers - Top advertisers on your site, and how much revenue you're getting from each
* Keywords - Site or [Page-specific keywords](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#page-specific-keywords) and how much revenue each is getting you
* Placements - Allows you to track different [ad placements](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#ad-placement-reporting) across your site (eg. homepage, blog sidebar)


## Does it matter if I use text or image ads?

We sell a mix of CPC (paid per click) and CPM (paid per view) ads.
Ads that are viewed and clicked more get more revenue.
The better and more visible the placement, generally the more money we both make.
Some of our best performing publishers use the text ad format,
but in places that are very visible or persistent in the page design.


## Any restrictions on ad placements?

Yes, please read our full [Publisher Policy](/publisher-policy/#ad-display) on ad display.


## How much will I make?

These numbers will vary based on your audience and topics that you write about.
Generally we are able to offer around $2-2.50 per 1,000 pageviews (CPM),
assuming a majority of US and European traffic.


## How can I be paid?

Please read our full [Publisher Policy](/publisher-policy/#payouts) on payouts.


## Why do I only see house ads?

You should generally see paid ads if you are in the US or EU.
If you're somewhere else in the world,
you might see paid ads or not.
The later you are in the day,
the more likely that you might see more unpaid ads if we haven't fully sold your specific location and keywords.
You can always look in your publisher dashboard to see more information on what is happening, once data has started to be collected.


## How do you target ads?

We target ads on two primary things: location and keywords.
Location targeting uses the IP address of the client,
but we only target this to the Country and US State level.
Keyword targeting comes from either the site or page the ad is shown on.
Sites have default keywords,
but publishers can override this with [Page-specific keywords](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#page-specific-keywords).
**We strongly recommend implementing Page-specific keywords to increase the success of your ads**,
if you have this metadata on your site.


## How do I ensure the ads will perform well on my site?

Without tracking users, the best way to make sure ads perform well
is to have a good placement to have good targeting based on content.
A good ad placement means the ad is clearly visible and separate from the content of the page.
How long the ad is visible on the page is also a factor.
If the UX of your site means that users quickly scroll past ads, the ads on your site won't perform well.

For better content targeting, letting us know about the content of your pages with
[page-specific keywords](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#page-specific-keywords),
can allow us to better target the ads.
For example, we can target an ad for a DevOps related service to DevOps related content.

Better performance and better targeting will generally result in more money for publishers like yourself.
While most advertisers pay per impression, some pay per click which yields more money for better performance.
Content targeted ads to more specific content can also results in higher click through rates
and we charge higher rates for more targeted ads.
